Matt and Coral meet at Moon-Tide Tea house.
Coral: I’m terribly sorry I’m late! My son Marlin needed help with this huge art project. He always tells me at the last minute he needs a poster board. 
Matt: Don’t worry about it at all, kids be kids.
Coral: Thank you for understanding. This is such a beautiful tea house and a great choice! I wouldn't have expected anything less from a chef. Marlin is such a picky eater sometimes, I wish I had your expertise in cooking.
Matt: Well now I’m invested! What does Marlin like? Give me the pickiest thing about him.
Coral: He eats exactly four things without negotiation. Plain seaweed noodles, sea cucumber bites if they’re not touching anything else on the plate, anything that is somehow soft and crunchy at the same time, and fish sticks. 
Matt: Crunchy and soft at the same time? This kid is hard to please, haha! Okay here's what I'm thinking. You let me cook for him sometime. Nothing fancy, nothing that looks scary on the plate. I'll do something crunchy and soft and I guarantee he won't call it adequate.
Coral: You don’t have to do that. 
Matt: I know I don't. I want to. Feeding a picky kid who ends up asking for seconds is honestly  the best feeling. 
Coral: You’re very kind Matt. I think you're wonderful. I genuinely do. But I don't think I feel —
Matt: Yeah, me either actually.
Coral: Really?
Matt: Really. But I meant what I said about cooking for Marlin. That offer has nothing to do with gestures vaguely between them—any of this.
Coral: Thank you for letting me be honest. Same time next week but just tea?
Matt: Bring Marlin, I’ll figure out something crunchy and soft.
Coral and Matt continue to enjoy tea and snacks
Coral: Matt is a special guy but we’re staying as just friends.
