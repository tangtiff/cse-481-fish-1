Gary and Leona meet at a Salt Water Park
Leona: Hi there Darlin’. You must be Gary, I’m Leona. Aren’t you the most handsome fish I’ve laid eyes on since last tide. I swear, the good Lord took his sweet time on you, sugar. 
Gary: I’ve been waiting to meet you, your dating profile made me laugh, I thought I was the only one.
Leona: Oh, stop it. You’re gonna make me blush right through my scales. Now tell me, what is it you do with yourself all day, darlin’?
Gary: I mostly drift and see where the current takes me. No real plans, just going with the flow, you know?
Leona: I tried that once. Just drifting. And then I realized, I am the current.
Gary: What does that mean?
Leona: It means I built my own little spot in this corner of the reef. I wake up every mornin’ knowing exactly which direction I’m swimmin’ and why. And bless your heart, I don’t think I can spend my evenings with someone whose whole plan is wherever the water goes. I’ve spent too long building a life I actually love to hand the oars to somebody who doesn't even want oars. 
Gary: So… this was over before it started?
Leona: Oh honey, we had a lovely fifteen minutes. You take care of yourself, sweetheart. The reef is big and wide and full of lovely fish who’ll drift right to you.
After date
Leona: Lord, I love a good date. Almost as much as I love going home to my own place. Darlin’, I realized I want to swim with the currents. Just me and the tide.
+5 satisfaction. Fulfilled 
Gary: Leona is an independent woman and I respect that. However, I’m still looking for a date so put me back in the dating pool!
+0 satisfaction. Neither heartbroken, nor fulfilled
