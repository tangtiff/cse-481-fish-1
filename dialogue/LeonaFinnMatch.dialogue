Leona and Finn meet at a cafe.
Leona: Howdy, you must be Finn from Reel Love? I’m Leona. 
Finn: Yes, I scheduled 35 minutes for this meeting. For the record, I did not choose this and lost a bet. Shall we proceed? I am a very busy fish.
Leona: Proceed? Sugar, this isn't a board meeting. And “Lost a bet” you say it like a tragedy. You have the posture of a fish waitin’ on a performance review. Relax darlin’ ain’t no one evaluation’ you.
Finn: That’s incorrect. I’m evaluating how soon I can leave without seeming too rude. 
Leona: Bless your honesty—it’s almost charming.
Finn: To pass the time, I’ll ask the typical questions. So, what do you look for in a partner?
Leona: Oh, to be honest sugar I don’t know if I’m lookin’ for one at all. 
Finn: Then why are you here? 
Leona: I don’t really know. I do enjoy the honeymoon feelin’ of love, but after a while I realize I do just fine driftin’ on my own. I like my mornings quiet, my nights predictable, and my heart unoccupied. 
Finn: That seems inefficient. 
Leona: I ain’t tryin’ to optimize my life. I’m tryin' to enjoy it. 
Finn: Enjoyment is not a sustainable metric.
Leona: Neither is loneliness wrapped in productivity, sweetheart.
Finn: I could be closing a Clamazon future deal right now.
Leona: And I could be swimmin’ solo under the moon and not explainin’ a thing to nobody. 
Finn: Then this interaction is unnecessary. I don’t believe in chemistry.
Leona: And I don't believe in schedules. 
Finn: I will inform my colleague that the bet has been honored. 
Leona: And I realized I am more than happy by myself.
Finn: Acceptable outcome.
Leona: Take care now, Finn. Hope you win your next bet.
Finn: Statistically, I will.
They swim off in opposite directions.
Finn:  I got my dare fulfilled and that was it. Now, I have meetings to attend to.
+0 satisfaction. Neither heartbroken, neither fulfilled 
Leona: Hiya sweetheart. Thank you for matching me with Finn. Truth is, I didn’t want him—didn’t want any of it. For the first time I felt like I finally confronted the truth. I’m not waitin’ for the right fish, I’m exactly where I want to be. It’s not loneliness, it's freedom and peace. You can take me off the datin’ list. Sea you around, sugar.
+5 satisfaction. Fulfilled
