Finn and Coral meet along the shore edge
Coral: Hi, you must be Finn. I’m so sorry, Marlin had an emergency.
Finn: You’re late.
Coral: Three minutes—
Finn: I don’t do late. I’ll let it slide this once, what do you do anyway?
Coral: Office coordinator at Tidewater and Associates. I stepped down, I was a senior before Marlin. The hours weren't compatible so I took a step back. You know it?
Finn: I absorbed it last year and kept the staff. However, most people would have pushed for flexibility rather than step back.
Coral: I didn’t want to be the person who asks for flexibility and then delivers less, so I stepped back and delivered fully. 
The food arrives. Coral lights up at her sea bloom tart.
Finn: It’s a sea bloom tart.
Coral: I never get to order it. Marlin has a very specific approved food list and sea bloom tart did not make the cut. 
Finn: You give up your dinner order for a seven year old?
Coral: Every parent does.
Finn: Inefficient.
Coral: Completely worth it.
Finn: On your profile it says you coach drift ball. On a coordinator’s salary?
Coral: Someone has to. We manage just fine thank you.
Finn: You coach Saturday mornings? I’ll move my meeting.
Coral: You want to come watch kids play drift ball?
Finn: I want to see if you're as disorganized on a field as you are arriving for dinner.
Coral: Marlin will talk to you the entire time by the way. I can’t stop him.
Finn: I’ll manage.
After date
Coral: Finn came to drift ball practice. Marlin talked his ear off to him but he didn’t complain once. He told me my coaching rotation was suboptimal on the way out. Which, fair. But he also stayed the whole time..
+5 satisfaction 
Finn: She works harder than anyone on my current staff and she's a coordinator. That's not her fault. That's bad management. 
Finn: The kid talks a lot. Gets it from her. I don’t generally have patience for that.
Finn: I stayed two hours.
