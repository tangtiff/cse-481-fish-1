(They meet at a fancy restaurant chosen by Pearl)
Pearl: Hello, thank you for meeting me, my name is Pearl.
Kelp: Nice to meet you love, the name's Kelp. Nice restaurant you chose here!
Pearl: Yes, they serve an exquisite lobster risotto. Let us get right to the point: I am looking for someone who will provide me company in my daily life, but not get in my way.
Pearl: I have a lot of responsibilities, so if that scares you, you should just leave now.
Kelp: Leave? Darling, I only just got here.
Kelp: And with all those responsibilities, it sounds like what you need is an opportunity to let loose. Happy to say I happen to be an expert in that area.
Pearl: Let’s briefly entertain the notion that I might benefit from, as you say, "letting loose". What do you have in mind?
Kelp: Well, there’s an adorable little club just down the street, if you'd like to join me for a dance or two after our meal...
Pearl: Maybe I shall.
They chat more over dinner, then dance the night away at the club Kelp mentioned.
Pearl: They were certainly different than what I am used to, but not in a bad way.
Pearl: I think occasional breaks to "let loose" might be exactly what I need to continue operating at peak efficiency. Thank you for introducing us.
+5 satisfaction. Fulfilled
Kelp: WOW. She was cool, confident, and dances like a pro. I think I'm in love.
+5 satisfaction. Fulfilled
