Leona: Hello, darlin’. How can someone like me find a nice date for tonight? All my previous partners have just been darn trash. Sea, I don’t mean for my relationships to sink, they just forget how to swim.
Leona: One minute they’re sayin’ they love my laugh, the way my tail glimmers in the moonlight—but next thing you know, I’m driftin’ away and gaspin’ for air. Baby, I live in the ocean. Space is kinda my thing. 
- Are you sure you want to be dating if you want space?
- Sounds like you enjoy time by yourself instead
Leona: Oh now don’t look so surprised, I’m excited this time. Truly. I even polished my pearls and practiced my smile in a shipwreck mirror, so you know I’m serious. I told myself, This is it. New tide, new love, no more wash-ups.
Leona: I’m ready to date again. I am. I like the idea of it—someone laughin’ at my jokes, holdin’ my hand, sayin’ things like, “I’ve never met anyone like you,” as if that’s news. I imagine sweet beginnings, easy swims, someone who calls me their lucky catch and means it kindly.
- Okay leave your information with me, I’ll find a lucky catch for you
- Alright I think I know what you’re looking for
Leona: Thank you sweetheart, don’t keep me waitin’ too long now!
- Start again => start
- End the conversation => END
=> END
